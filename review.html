					I visited it recently it was a real creepy old house full of history and ghosts.it was so cold 
					one could feel the presence of something.would have liked to see up stairs ,only down stairs 
					open to the public.well worth the visit.would love to see it restored to its former beauty.

					Get there early in high season save you waiting. Be prepared to leave your brain in the car
					and just go with it for the fun, great way to scare the kids

					I visited loftus hall recently with a friend of mine. The guided ghost tour was scary and we enjoyed
					every scream and frightened laugh. a must if you are in the area.the staff could not  have been more 
					friendly. an all round great place to visit. we will definitely go again with a few more friends this time.

					It started well then suddenly finished. I was expected something more. Definitely 10 is too hight for what you get.
					A honest price would be 5. Definitely not ok paying for the parking.

					<b> Patrick Rich </b> <br>
